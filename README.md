# Unban_Nextcloud
After several login attempts with a bad password or a bad username, the user is banned. This application allows the administrator to unban the user of a single click in the administration part. 

For the moment this app is in progress.
The code is in the dev branch for the Nextcloud 16.
And in the Nextcloud-15 branch for this version.
